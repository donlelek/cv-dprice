Dear Selection Committee, 

I would like to submit my application for the faculty position in the School (Position 555555). I am a practicing veterinarian with a PhD in epidemiology, and am currently a PhD student at the Atlantic Veterinary College (AVC) in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada.

For most of my veterinary career I have been controlling and preventing infectious diseases in animal populations through innovative management strategies that seek to minimize the use of chemotherapeutants.  I work predominantly on aquaculture species used for human food consumption, ranging from salmonid and cyprinids finfish to mollusks and crustaceans; however, I have also worked with poultry and in public health.  My research program is currently engaged with industries on both coasts of Canada, in Chile, Norway, and China. I am also a practicing primary care aquatic animal veterinarian, which keeps me abreast of treatment practices and issues facing aquaculture industries.  As an expert on veterinary practices in aquaculture settings, as well as infectious disease control and my background in public health, I believe I will be able to make significant contributions to your multi-disciplinary team at the Paul G. Allen School for Global Animal Health. 

The advertised position at Washington State University is for a person with expertise in epidemiology who can assess patterns of antibiotic resistance and efficacy of intervention strategies. These topics are especially relevant to aquaculture where, when antibiotics are applied, they are given to large numbers of animals simultaneously. The use of therapeutic products to treat fish populations is not regulated in many developing countries and this can be problematic as the aquatic environment serves as a perfect medium for interactions between organisms, including the transfer of resistance genes and plasmids. I recently started evaluating the use and efficacy of antibiotics and anti-parasitic drugs in different aquaculture settings. I currently supervise two graduate students on projects that focus on understanding spatial and temporal trends in treatment efficacy, and reasons and consequences for treatment failures.  We have two manuscripts that will be submitted for publication very soon, which identify several innovative changes to the applications of antibiotics that should improve efficacy and reduce overall use.  We also have a manuscript that will be submitted in December on area management of sea lice that demonstrates how coordination of treatments between neighboring salt water net pen farms reduces the overall need for anti-parasitic therapeutants.  These findings have already been presented to industry stakeholders and are being implemented on a pilot project scale in Chile. 

In addition to conducting research and a veterinary service for the university, I also have been teaching epidemiology to veterinarians, graduate students, public health students, and undergraduates for over 12 years. I also have experience teaching on-line graduate courses through the University of Sydney, Australia.  At UPEI, I have been teaching aquatic ecosystem health rotations to fourth year veterinary students for the last three years. My approach to teaching is to include as many problem-based learning activities as possible and promote student interaction. I have found this to be effective in clinical rotations, classroom lectures, and small graduate classes. My course evaluations, which I would be happy to share with you, indicate that my students value these activities and find them to be effective learning tools. I currently supervise five PhD students and one 4th year honors student, and each of these students plays an active role in my research program.

My short term goals are to incorporate economics into my disease control strategies to better inform stakeholders of the financial consequences of implementing or not implementing disease prevention strategies.   When working with commercial partners it is critical that I speak their language, and to this end I am taking my MBA. I will graduate from the program in 2016, and have already seen the benefit of this new knowledge, especially for my most recent research projects on antibiotic and anti-parasitic use on salmon farms, where elimination of a single treatment can save $40,000.  

My long term career goals are to make significant contributions to veterinary epidemiology and infectious disease control. My experience and training have prepared me well for a position on a multidisciplinary team that integrates public health and veterinary medicine.  My international experience in applied infectious disease epidemiology and veterinary medicine of aquatic animals will enable me to contribute significantly to your program. 

I am excited about the prospect of working at Washington State University and moving to the beautiful city of Pullman.  Please let me know if you need any additional information.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,
