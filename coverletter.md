**Dear Selection Committee,**  

I would like to submit my application for the Infectious Disease Epidemiologist 
position (competition **031A18**) for the Department of Health Management at the 
Atlantic Veterinary College (AVC). I am a veterinarian with a PhD in epidemiology
recently awarded by the University of Prince Edward Island. I am currently working 
as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow for the Canada Excellence Chair in Aquatic Epidemiology 
at the AVC in the same University.  

Although I have been in academia for a short time, 
for the past 18 years I have been involved with the salmon industry in Chile. 
I started as a diagnostics laboratory technician but soon moved to a field job 
in the same company. Since then, I have worked as a field veterinarian in several 
companies, and have been involved in various aspects of salmon farming, from eggs to 
harvest. I have designed and implemented strategies to prevent the occurrence
and spread of disease, and minimize the use of antibiotics. I have been involved 
in the management and control of a budget, and I have also managed small teams of 
veterinarians and field technicians.

Over the years, I have witnessed the devastating effects that infectious 
disease outbreaks and environmental changes can have over the sustainability 
of the industry. I switched to academia with the objective of producing 
high-quality research to find solutions for these issues and assist the industry
and authorities in their transition towards an evidence-based decision-making process.  

The advertised position requires an applicant with strong abilities in applying
and developing quantitative methods. As such, I want to highlight my experience in 
modeling antibiotic treatment failure and the effect of fallowing over
the occurrence of piscirickettsiosis in Chile. Although I used classical 
methods to assess these effects in our studies, I have used a novel approach by
controlling for spatiotemporal factors in my analyses. I have also participated 
in a project where the risk of introduction and the risk of spread of infectious 
diseases between hatcheries in a company were estimated using a risk analysis tool. 
I am currently involved in the study of disease transmission between seawater 
farms using simulation modeling, and will be participating in an international
research project commissioned by the fishing and aquaculture authority in Chile
to improve the control of piscirickettsiosis.  

I have published three articles and recently submitted two manuscripts to peer-reviewed 
journals. I have assisted my supervisor in the teaching of an aquaculture course, and I have 
presented the findings of our studies at two international conferences and several local meetings 
in Canada and Chile, where some of our suggestions are currently being implemented. 
I believe I have the ability to work efficiently as a member of a multi-disciplinary 
team and make significant contribution to the scientific community.  

My short-term goals are to further improve my modeling and programming skills, 
to develop my teaching abilities, and to consolidate as an independent researcher. 
My long-term career goals are to make a significant contribution to the field of veterinary 
epidemiology and to contribute to the sustainability of aquaculture.  

I am excited about the prospect of working at you prestigious institution. Please 
let me know if you need any additional information. I look forward to hearing from you.   

\ 

Sincerely yours,
